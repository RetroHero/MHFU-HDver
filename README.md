## Upscaling Textures of Monster Hunter Freedom Unite

**Project created to attempt to preserve the visual and artistic identity of the game's original textures.**

This project was born from my dissatisfaction with some of the solutions adopted by the majority of projects that are based on this game.

Solutions that include replacing ground and object textures with high definition textures from other sources, mischaracterizin of the majority of environments.

So, inspired by AFOOT03939's work on (Monster Hunter Freedom HD.ver), which in my opinion is one of the best restoration works in the community, using textures from the PS2 versions, I decided to do the same with its successor, Monster Hunter Freedom Unite, which, unlike its predecessor, had many textures that were new to other versions.

I had to use (Monster Hunter Dos) and (Monster Hunter Frontier) as sources, games that have areas in common with the title in question.

Even so, many textures had to be corrected manually. I'm still not confident about their quality, but I believe that this work has already produced better results than other options out there.

I hope you like it!!!
